# Ai-paper-trade

# I might just do this as a side project

basically I will have it use yfinance to get loads of old data for a certain symbol and simulate a stock market in like 100x speed so the neural network can get trained really fast on a certain symbol, then we use robin_stocks or something similar to get near real time data and possibly have it do actual trades.

how the training will work:
reinforcement learning or some other thing that has it get rewarded for the more return it gets on a paper trade, it will analyze the current data and compares it to historical, gets a number of other factors including put and call numbers if available, as well as movement average to make a buy sell hold.

problems with that: it will go for very short profit and will probably rarely hold
a fix for that: reward it more for profit while holding instead of rewarding when it sells.

probably wont get anywhere, and im 100% over estimating claude 3.7 potential to code. (hint hint I actually dont know how to code this stuff, and will be learning how to do it as I develop this with ai)
